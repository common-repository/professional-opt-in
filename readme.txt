Drive users to your opt-in landing page without driving them crazy.

== Description ==

Professional Opt-in gently floats in from the bottom of the page without angering your users - causing them to bounce. Users can read your content and not get bombarded with obtrusive pop-ups asking for an email address before reading anything you have to offer. Professional Opt-in is for the new slow-sell economy.

* Free and quick! Get it working in just 1 minute.
* Customizable promo text and Call-to-Action button text.
* Appears when users scroll down the page - after they are interested.
* For short pages, call to action appears after 30 seconds.
* Works on mobile and desktop browsers - looks exactly the same.
* Uses the powerful and proven promo text - call-to-action combination.Â 
* Triggers special call-to-action events in Google Analytics (if available).
* Use on all pages or a combination of homepage, posts, pages, or archive / categories.
